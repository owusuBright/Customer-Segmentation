# Customer Segmentation
This project uses clustering techniques, such as K-means to segment customers based on their behavior and preferences, using Python. Customer segmentation is a process of dividing customers into groups or segments that share similar characteristics, such as demographics, purchase history, or loyalty. The goal of customer segmentation is to understand the needs and preferences of different customer groups, and to tailor marketing and sales strategies accordingly.

# Data
The data used in this project are from the Kaggle Customer Segmentation Data, which contains information about 8068 customers. The data are stored in a CSV file, with the following columns:

CustomerID: The unique ID of the customer

Gender: The gender of the customer (Male or Female)          

Married: The marital status of the customer       

Age: The age of the customer          

Graduated: Whether a graduate or not     

Profession: The profession of the customer    

WorkExperience:  Customer's work experience

SpendingScore:  The spending score of the customer based on their spending behavior and purchasing data 

FamilySize: Customer's family size   

# Tools
The tool used in this project is Python, a popular tool for data analysis and visualization. It is used to perform data manipulation, preprocessing, and clustering, using libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and scipy. It is also used to create charts that display the results of the clustering and the characteristics of the customer segments.

# Results
The results of this project are displayed in various plots and tables, showing the optimal number of clusters and the distribution of customers in each cluster. The results also show the characteristics and features of each customer segment, such as gender, age, income, and spending score. The results can help to identify the target customer groups and to design personalized marketing and sales campaigns for them.
